## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code

### Install for local development

Install project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

When the server is running, copy and paste the URL provided by SvelteKit.

> Pro tip: `npm run dev -- --open` starts the server and runs at the same time.

> Pro tip 2: You can also press 'o' to open your browser at the URL.

### Run code formatting

Run your code without making file changes:

```bash
npx prettier --check .
```

Run your code and make file changes:

```bash
npm run format
```
