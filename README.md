## ðŸ”§ Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code

### Install for local development

Install project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

When the server is running, copy and paste the URL provided by SvelteKit.

> Pro tip: `npm run dev -- --open` starts the server and runs at the same time.

> Pro tip 2: You can also press 'o' to open your browser at the URL.

### Run code formatting

Run your code without making file changes:

```bash
npx prettier --check .
```

Run your code and make file changes:

```bash
npm run format
```

## ðŸ’¡ Git Tips

Remember what we learned, and don't be afraid to reference [the git cheat sheet](https://files.brannan.cloud/docs/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) (https://files.brannan.cloud/docs/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

> Always double check your branch (`git status` or `git branch`) prior to committing! Also, getting in the habit of pulling changes (`git pull origin branch-name`) might save you a lot of headache in the future.

## ðŸ“¢ Asking for help

You can obviously DM me on Teams. However, I might not see it if it's during off-hours. You can also [open an issue on this repo](https://github.com/bananabrann/recipes.brannan.cloud/issues) or **comment on your draft PR** with your question.
