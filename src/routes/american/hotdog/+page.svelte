    Chop the onions, tomatoes, and any other toppings you'd like to use, such as pickles or sport
    peppers. Place them in separate bowls for easy access.

    You can either grill or boil the hotdog sausages. If grilling, preheat the grill to medium-high
    heat and cook the sausages for about 6-8 minutes, turning them occasionally until they're nicely
    browned. Add the hotdogs and let them cook for about 5 minutes.

    If you're using a grill, you can lightly toast the hotdog buns for a minute or two.
    Alternatively, you can wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave them for about 15-20
    seconds to warm them up.
