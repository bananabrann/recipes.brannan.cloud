    <li>
      In a large pot, bring the chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, salt, sesame oil, garlic, and
      ginger to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes to let the flavors infuse.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a small pot, bring some water to a boil. Carefully lower the eggs into the water and cook
      for 6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs or 8 minutes for hard-boiled eggs. Transfer the eggs to a
      bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Peel and cut the eggs in half.
    </li>
    <li>
      In another pot, cook the ramen noodles according to the package directions. Drain and rinse
      with cold water to prevent them from sticking together.
    </li>
    <li>
      To serve, divide the noodles among two large bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles. Top
      with chashu or ham, eggs, green onions, and nori.
