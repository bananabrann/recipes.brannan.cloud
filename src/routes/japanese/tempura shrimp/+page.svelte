  <h2>Instructions:</h2>

      Prepare the shrimp:
      Start by straightening the shrimp. Make a few shallow cuts on the underside of the shrimp and gently press it flat on a cutting board.
      Pat the shrimp dry using paper towels.
      Prepare the Tempura Batter:
    </li>
    <li>
      In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the egg.
      Add the cold water and ice cubes to the egg mixture.
      Sift in the all-purpose flour (and baking powder if using). Gently mix the ingredients together. Remember, it's okay if there are a few lumps left; overmixing can make the batter heavy.
      If using cornstarch, sift and mix it in as well.
      Frying the Shrimp:
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat the oil in a deep frying pan or pot to about 350°F (175°C).
      Holding the shrimp by the tail, dip them into the batter, making sure they are well-coated.
      Carefully place the battered shrimp into the hot oil. Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding.
      Fry until the shrimp turn a light golden color, typically about 2-3 minutes.
      Remove the shrimp using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.
      Prepare the Dipping Sauce (if using):
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix the soy sauce, mirin, and dashi stock or water in a bowl.
      Serve in individual small bowls, garnished with grated daikon radish and ginger.
      Serve:
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve the shrimp tempura hot with the dipping sauce on the side. Sprinkle a bit of salt to taste if desired.
      Enjoy your homemade shrimp tempura!
