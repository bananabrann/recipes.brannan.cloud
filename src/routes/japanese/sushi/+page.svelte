  <li>2 cups water</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place the rice into a colander and rinse until the water runs clear.</li>
  <li>
    Add the rice and 2 cups of water into a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl and heat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. Transfer the rice to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Fold thoroughly to combine. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature

  <li>
    Place one sheet of nori on a flat surface and press approximately 1/3-1/2 cup rice across the surface of the nori, going all the way to the edges. This is easiest if your fingers are slightly damp.

  <li>Place a piece of plastic wrap over the rice covered nori and invert on top of a sushi rolling mat so that the seaweed side is up.</li>
  <li>
    Place 2 shrimp, 2 strips of cucumber and 2 slices of avocado along one side of the nori.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press approximately 2 teaspoons of sesame seeds into the rice on the sushi roll.

  Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi then serve immediately.
