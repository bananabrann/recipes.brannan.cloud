<p>
  Tamales are a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa (a starchy dough, usually corn-based),
  which is steamed or boiled in a leaf wrapper, typically a corn husk. The wrapping is discarded
  before eating. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, chilies, or any
  preparation according to taste.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the Dough</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups of masa harina (a type of corn flour specifically for tamales and tortillas).</li>
  <li>1 cup of chicken broth (may need more to get to the right consistency).</li>
  <li>1 tsp baking powder.</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of lard or shortening.</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Filling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups of shredded cooked chicken.</li>
  <li>1 cup of salsa verde (green salsa) or a red chili sauce.</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of crumbled queso fresco or another cheese of your choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Corn husks (around 20, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes to an hour to soften).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the masa harina, baking powder, and salt.</li>
  <li>
    In another bowl, beat the lard or shortening until fluffy. Gradually beat in the masa mixture,
    then add the chicken broth until a spongy dough forms.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Prepare the Corn Husks</h3>
<li>
  Soak the corn husks in warm water for 30 minutes to an hour to soften them. Drain and set aside..
</li>
<h3>3. Assemble the Tamales</h3>
<li>Spread a spoonful of the masa dough onto the center of the corn husk.</li>
<li>Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center of the masa.</li>
<li>
  Fold the sides of the husk in, followed by the top and bottom. You're aiming to wrap the filling
  in the masa, then wrap the whole tamale in the husk.
</li>
<h3>4. Cook the Tamales</h3>
<li>
  Set up a steamer pot. If you don't have a steamer, you can place a metal colander or strainer over
  a large regular pot of boiling water. Just ensure the water doesn't touch the tamales.
</li>
<li>Place the tamales standing up in the steamer or colander.</li>
<li>
  Cover and steam over medium heat for about 60 minutes or until the masa separates easily from the
  husks.
</li>
<h3>5. Serve</h3>
<li>
  Let the tamales cool for a bit before serving. Unwrap them from the corn husks and serve with
  additional salsa, cheese, and other desired toppings.
